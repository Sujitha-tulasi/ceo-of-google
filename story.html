    <p><b><i>Sundar Pichai,</i></b> in full Pichai Sundararajan, (born June 10, 1972, Madras [now Chennai], Tamil Nadu, India), Indian-born American executive who was<b>CEO of both Google, Inc. (2015– ), and its holding company, Alphabet Inc. (2019– ).</b>As a boy growing up in Madras, Pichai slept with his brother in the living room of the cramped family home, but his father, an electrical engineer at the British multinational GEC, saw that the boys received a good education. At an early age Pichai displayed an interest in technology and an extraordinary memory, especially for telephone numbers. After earning a degree in metallurgy (B.Tech., 1993) and a silver medal at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, he was awarded a scholarship to study at Stanford University (M.S. in engineering and materials science, 1995). He remained in the United States thereafter, working briefly for Applied Materials (a supplier of semiconductor materials) and then earning an M.B.A. (2002) from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

    <h2>Sundar Pichai's significant success</h2>
    <p>Following a short stint at the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co., Pichai joined <b>Google</b> in 2004 as the head of product management and development. He initially worked on the Google Toolbar, which enabled those using the <b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</b> and <b>Mozilla Firefox Web browsers</b> to easily access the Google search engine. Over the next few years, he was directly involved in the development of Google’s own browser, Chrome, which was released to the public in 2008. That same year Pichai was named <b>vice president</b> of product development, and he began to take a more-active public role. By 2012 he was a senior vice president, and two years later he was made product chief over both <b>Google and the Android smartphone operating system.</b></p>
    <p>In 2011 Pichai reportedly was aggressively pursued for employment by microblogging service <b>Twitter</b>, and in 2014 he was touted as a possible CEO for Microsoft, but in both instances he was granted large financial packages to remain with Google. He also was known to have helped negotiate Google’s $3.2 billion deal to acquire Nest Labs in 2014. Therefore, when Google cofounders <b>Larry Page and Sergey Brin</b> announced the creation of Alphabet Inc., in August 2015, it came as no surprise to industry insiders that <b>Pichai was named CEO of Google</b>, which was reorganized as a subsidiary. In December 2019 he also was named <b>CEO of Alphabet,</b> replacing Page, who stepped down.</p>

        In 2009, he released Chrome OS, an operating system based on the Linux kernel that allows you to accomplish anything online without the need for a hard drive or software installed on your computer.
        He is also a co-founder of the open source microblogging application Jaiku.
        Forbes named him one of the most powerful individuals in business in 2017.
        He also received several awards, including the World Economic Forum's Top 100 Global Thought Leaders Award; The Webby Awards' Digital Visionary Award; Variety's Visionary Award; Tony Robbins' Game Changer Award; Consumer Technology Association's Excellence in Innovation Award; CNBC's Tech Titan Award, and NDTV Profit's Man of the Year in Business Leadership Award.
